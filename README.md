This script adds a right-click context menu option for components in the Fusion 360 browser. Here's how it works:

It creates a command definition for "Add Dimensions to Description"
It adds this command to two key panels:

BrowserCommandPanel: This is the right-click menu in the browser panel
SelectPanel: This is the right-click menu when selecting components in the model view


The implementation is still using our working dimension calculation code that fixes the units issue (multiplying by 10)

To use this script:

Save it as a Fusion 360 add-in (not just a script)
Run it through the Add-Ins panel
Once it's running, you can:

Right-click on a component in the browser
Right-click on selected components in the model view
Select multiple components first, then right-click
Choose "Add Dimensions to Description" from the context menu



The script will update the descriptions for all selected components with their correct dimensions.
